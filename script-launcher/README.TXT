Perl launcher generator version 1.0.0
-------------------------------------
This program generates a small executable for launching Perl script. It
can use the following programs as Perl interpreter for your script:

  * ActivePerl
  * The OpenKore/VisualKore launcher programs (start.exe, wxstart.exe, etc.)

The executable will automatically detect whether ActivePerl is installed. If
it is not, it will try to search for OpenKore launcher programs. If those
don't exist either, then the executable will ask the user to download
ActivePerl. So users will never have to use the commandline to start your
script. If your program crashes (or exits with a non-zero exit code), then
the executable will show an error dialog, allowing the user to see the
program's error message before the console window closes.

This program is only intended to work on Windows. Linux users don't need it.


Usage
-----
To create such an executable, doubleclick on generator.exe (which was
generated by this program; it launches generator.pl which is the actual
generator)
