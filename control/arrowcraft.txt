# Archers have the special skill Arrow Craft, which allows you to create
# arrows using certain items.
# If you want Kore to automatically create arrows with Arrow Craft, then
# you can do that by editing this file.
#
# In this file, specify the ingredients that you need to create arrows.
# The format is as follows:
# (item name) (amount)
#
# For example:
# Red Blood 1
# Garlet
#
# This will allow Kore to create Fire Arrows and Iron Arrows by using
# the above items.
