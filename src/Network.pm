# $conState contains the connection state:
# 1: Not connected to anything		(next step -> connect to master server).
# 2: Connected to master server		(next step -> connect to login server)
# 3: Connected to login server		(next step -> connect to character server)
# 4: Connected to character server	(next step -> connect to map server)
# 5: Connected to map server; ready and functional.
#
# Special states:
# 1.2 (set by $config{gameGuard} == 2): Wait for the server response allowing us
#      to continue login
# 1.3 (set by parseMsg()): The server allowed us to continue logging in, continue
#      where we left off
# 1.5 (set by plugins): There is a special sequence for login servers and we must
#      wait the plugins to finalize before continuing
# 2.5 (set by parseMsg()): Just passed character selection; next 4 bytes will be
#      the account ID
