# This task allows you to follow an actor (the target). This task will
# continue infinitely until you stop it, or until the target has
# disappeared from our sight.
#
# Note that this task does not handle situations where the target has entered
# a portal. It also does not look up the target's coordinate using the party
# list, of the target is a player who's in the party. This task is specialized
# in following a single actor within the same map. More advanced follow
# abilities should be implemented by a different task (TODO: write such a
# task).

# Create a new Task::FollowActor object. The following options are allowed:
# `l
# - All options allowed for Task->new() except 'mutexes'.
# - actor (required) - The Actor to follow.
# - actorList (required) - The ActorList which contains the actor object.
#                          This is used to check whether the actor is still on screen.
# - maxDistance - The maximum distance that the actor may be away from you.
# - minDistance - If the distance to the actor is greater than maxDistance, then walk
#                 to the actor until you're within distance minDistance.
