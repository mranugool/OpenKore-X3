# MODULE DESCRIPTION: Entity lookup and matching
#
# This module contains functions for matching input typed by the player with
# an in-game entity (e.g. players, monsters, items). These functions make
# it easy to match an entity using a number or a name.

##
# Actor::Player Match::player(ID, [boolean partial_match = false])
# ID: either a number in the player list, or a player name.
# Returns: an Actor::Player object, or undef if not found.
#
# Find an player in the global player list based on the given match criteria.
# You can either find a player by name, or by number (as displayed in the 'pl' command).
#
# Example:
# # Suppose these players are on screen:
# # 0     SuperPlayer
# # 1     BigKnight
# # 3     MyHunter
# Match::player(1);           # Returns the Actor::Player object for BigKnight
# Match::player(2);           # undef - player 2 does not exist
# Match::player("MyHunter");  # Returns the Actor::Player object for MyHunter
# Match::player("someone");   # undef - there is no such player on screen
