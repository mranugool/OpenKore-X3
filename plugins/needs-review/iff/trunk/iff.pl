# IFF (Identify Friend or Foe) Plugin
#
# This plugin is meant as a helper for GVG AIs to determine which players are
# enemies. It currently cannot handle monsters.
#
# A foe is anyone who is not a friend.
# A friend is anyone who is:
# * a member of your party
# * a member of your guild
# * a member of an allied guild
# * a member of a guild in $config{iff_friendlyGuilds}
# * a player listed in $config{iff_friendlyPlayers}
#
# This plugin provides:
# * an 'iff' command to list friendliness of all players on screen
# * an 'iff <name>' command to list the friendliness of a specific player
# * the function IFF::foe($player) which returns 1 iff $player is a foe
