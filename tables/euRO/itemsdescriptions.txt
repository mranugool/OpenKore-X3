If we dry this nut it will become a cacao bean and if we then fry and grind the cacao beans they will became a 
cacao paste. To make chocolate we need to solidify the cacao paste with milk, but we must also concentrate the cacao paste
and extract the fat from it then it will become cocoa and the extracted fat will be cacao butter.
