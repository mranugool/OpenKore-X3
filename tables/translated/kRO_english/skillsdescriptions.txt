Duration:^777777 10 sec ^000000
Effect:^777777 Creates a 3x3 cell cloud (although the animation only appears to cover the center cell!) around the target cell that blocks all ranged Physical attacks.
This means that it also blocks the bow attacks of players, so take care not to prevent any Hunters or Bow Thieves in the party from being able to do damage!
Monsters count as being "ranged" if their attack has a range of 4 or more cells. Pneuma cannot be cast if it is targeted to overlap an already existing Pneuma area or a Safety Wall cell.
Does not block splash damage or negate the Flee reducing effects of having multiple targets attacking you. Do note that although you can see the animation on top of a Land Protector, Pneuma will have no effect. ^000000

Duration:^777777 5 + 5*SkillLV sec ^000000
Catalyst:^0000ff 1 Blue Gemstone ^000000
Effect:^777777 Creates a warp portal at the targeted cell after a destination is selected from a list. This spell cannot be cast under a monster or player.
If anyone steps onto the targeted cell while the destination is being selected, the spell will fail. After successful casting, anyone stepping onto the affected cell will be teleported to the selected destination.
The destinations that may be selected are set by the use of the /memo command while standing in the desired location and by your current Save Point.
You may not set a memo point on Indoors map (dungeons and inside buildings in cities) and some maps that are far away from cities. If you make a new Memo Point on a map where you already have a Memo Point, that Memo Point will be replaced.
After filling all 3 possible Memo Points, setting a new Memo Point will replace the oldest current Memo Point (the bottom one on the list). The number of Memo Points available to you is equal to the SkillLV - 1 (therefore, at level 1 you have no memo points available and can only cast a Warp Portal to your Save Point).
The maximum capacity of people that the caster can warp at a time is 8 regardless of its skill level. No more than 3 Warp Portals cast by the one caster can be in effect at the same time. If the caster leaves the map where the portal has been cast, the portal disappears. ^000000

Area effect skills and spells can't hit you (except Heaven's Drive). Insects, Demons and Boss monsters are not affected by the hide effect. If you get hit by anything while hiding, you will be revealed.

Duration:^777777 300 - 50*SkillLV sec ^000000
Catalyst:^777777 1 Trap ^000000
Effect:^777777 Creates an Ankle Snare in the targeted cell. Any monster that steps within 1 cell of the trap will become snared for 5*SkillLV/(Target AGI*0.1) seconds (minimum of 3 seconds). In PvP zones, players may be snared too (including the creator of the trap!).
Boss monsters are snared for 1/5th of the normal time and will teleport almost certainly when snared. A snared target cannot sit, stand or move away from the cell on which they are snared, but can use skills and items and make attacks on anyone within range.
The skill Remove Trap can be used to cancel an Ankle Snare that has already caught a player. Ankle Snare traps are invisible in PvP, but any player who can see the Hunter laying the trap will be able to see the trap until they move out of sight of it.
The use of any invisibility detection skill will reveal the trap. If not tripped by the end of the duration, the Ankle Snare will turn back into a Trap item on the floor and can be reclaimed. ^000000

Cool Down:^777777 1 sec ^000000

Effect:^777777 Orders your Falcon to attack, delivering SkillLV hits to all enemies in a 3x3 area around the target for a total of ([DEX/10] + [INT/2] + 3*Steel Crow SkillLV + 40)*2) using Neutral Element. This skill ignores Def and MDEF and damage modification cards for size and family, but not elemental property.
In addition, there is a 0.3%*LUK chance of Blitz Beat occurring automatically per shot with a bow. This so called auto-blitz beat is less effective than a manual one and the full damage is split evenly between all targets affected.
For example, an auto-blitz beat that hits 3 targets will do 1/3 of the normal damage to each. Also, the total number of hits it delivers is based on the users job level and is equal to [(Job Level-1)/10]+1. ^000000

Required For:^777777 Brandish Spear, Cavalry Mastery, Concentration (Lord Knight), Spiral Pierce (Lord Knight), Head Crush (Lord Knight) ^000000
Max Level:^777777 1 ^000000
Type:^000099 Passive ^000000
Effect:^777777 This skill allows the character to ride a Peco Peco. Mounted characters gain an additional 25% walking speed (cumulative with AGI UP) and the maximum weight limit a character can carry is increased by 1000.
Mounted characters also attack at half the normal speed, but this penalty can be reduced or offset by levels in Cavalry Mastery. While mounted, the size modifier of spear vs. medium size is 100% instead of 75%.
The Peco Peco must be hired from Peco Peco Breeder in Prontera (55/350) at a cost of 2500z. If the character dismounts (by clicking on the "OFF" button in the equipment window), then the Peco Peco disappears and a new one must be hired. ^000000

When a second weapon enchanting spell effect (from Enchant Poison or Aspersio currently) is cast on a target, then it will replace the first spell effect.
Aspersio can also be used as a weak attack. Using shift-click, you can target an Undead property or Demon family monsters and inflict 40 points of Holy property damage that ignores all defenses. Against other kinds of monsters, it does no damage, but consumes the Holy Water and SP anyway. ^000000

Effect:^777777 Creates a Kyrie Eleison effect on the target character. This effect will block MaxHPofTarget*(10+2*SkillLV)% damage OR (5+SkillLV/2) hits, whichever is reached first.
Damage in excess of the amount blocked will transfer through and count as a hit of lowered damage. Hits are only assessed when a blow would normally land and not for every swing by a monster (despite showing an "Auto Guard" graphic with every swing for the effected player and a miss for every other player).
Any Magic attack will do full damage to the affected target, while still counting against the maximum damage and number of hits of Kyrie Eleison. Casting Holy Light or Assumptio on someone with this effect will cancel it entirely. When a second instance is cast on a target, then it will replace the first instance. ^000000

Therefore, there is a certain maximum number of waves than any one monster can be affected during the duration of the spell (there will be less waves if the monster enters late or is knocked back out for any reason).

Effect:^777777 Creates a 5x5 area sanctuary effect around the targeted cell. Characters and non-undead/demon monsters within the sanctuary are healed (see amount below) once a second unless at Maximum HP.
Undead property and Demon family monsters take Holy property damage equal to half the sanctuary's heal, rounded down and are knocked back out of the effect each time. The maximum number of valid healing targets is equal to 6+2*SkillLV, the maximum number of valid damage targets is equal to 3+SkillLV.
The spell affecting one player or monster once is counted as 1 target. If it affects a player or monster more than once, then it will count as a valid target more than once. If the maximum number of valid targets is exceeded, the spell will come to an end prematurely.
Valid targets are determined by the following priority:
1/ Player with Current HP less than Maximum HP.
2/ Non-Undead property/Demon family monsters with Current HP less than Maximum HP.
3/ Undead property and Demon family monsters.
Multiple Sanctuaries can be stacked on each other and as long as the maximum number of valid targets is not exceeded, each will last to their full duration.
Note: Sanctuary is the one of the two only means of healing the Emperium in the War of Emperium battles. While it is a skill that is by no means essential to have in a War of Emperium priest, have one or more priests with a high level of the skill in a guild could be very useful. ^000000

Duration:^777777 Instant ^000000
Effect:^777777 Hits the target up to LV*LV-1 times with a Water elemental attack of (100+30*SkillLV)% MATK. You must stand on water or on a Deluge (Sage skill) cell to successfully use this spell.
The damage for each hit is calculated individually and the damage numbers do not show as adding up, also casting Lex Aeterna (Priest Skill) on the target will only affect the first hit.
This is the strongest single target spell in-game. The number of water balls that you are actually able cast also depends on the amount of water you are standing in.
In any given X by X grid, the game determines that you are surrounded by (X*X)-1 cells. So, at level 4/5 Waterball, you can cast up to (5*5)-1, or 24 water balls.
However, if you're only standing in a 3x3 pool, you will only cast 8 water balls. If you're standing in a freaky grid (like a partially-used Deluge), the number of balls cast is equal to the number of water-occupied cells in your grid, so if you're in a cell like this:

O = empty
X = water
* = player

OOOOO
OOOOO
XX*XX
OOOOO
OOOOO

...you'll only cast 4 water balls with level 4/5. With level 2/3, you'll only cast 2 water balls, since only 2 are in the 3x3 grid surrounding you.

This is particularly useful to keep in mind when you're with a Deluge Sage, since Waterball uses up the Deluge cells.
You can determine which cells are used by how you stand in the cast area (every cast will wipe out the respective grid section around you, centered on you), and maximize the effectiveness of the water ball spells you cast. ^000000

Cool Down:^777777 0.5 sec ^000000
Duration:^777777 Instant ^000000
Catalyst:^777777 1 Acid Bottle ^000000
Effect:^777777 Throw an ^66cc33Acid Bottle^777777 at your opponent with a small chance to break their armor, and inflict the external bleeding status. This skill ignores armor defense, and hits regardless of Flee.
VIT defense is calculated in, however. While the damage can be blocked by Pneuma, the chance to break armor remains. Kyrie, however, blocks both the damage and the chance of breaking armor, as well as a Crusader with Auto Guard.
A successful armor break calculation makes the target use the /omg emoticon. That doesn't automatically mean they had their armor broken; even when using the Chemical Protection Armor skill or wearing an Immortal armor, the /omg will display itself so long as the attack was considered a success.
Just like Demonstration, the damage is increased via +ATK cards, and status and +% cards have no effect. It's also unaffected by elements. The ^66cc33Acid Bottle^777777 is consumed at the beginning of the cast, as opposed to the end like the other potion skills.
This means that if you are interrupted while casting, the bottle is lost with nothing to show for it. Damage is (100+40*SkillLV)% ATK. ^000000
[LV 1]^777777 3% chance to damage Armor, 3% chance of Bleeding ^000000

Cast Time:^777777 2 sec ^000000
Cool Down:^777777 0.5 sec ^000000
Duration:^777777 35 + 5*SkillLV sec (only 60 sec at LV 5 confirmed) ^000000
Effect:^777777 Summon various plants to attack monsters or players. The level you have determines the HP of the plant, while the level you use determines the type of plant summoned, the duration, and the amount of ^66cc33Plant Bottles^777777 consumed.
The HP formula is 2230+200*Possessed SkillLV per plant (yes, these have significantly more HP than normal ones), all other stats remain the same. If you have less than the total amount of bottles required for the Skill Level you used, it will take the rest of the bottles, and summon that many plants.
So if you have three plant bottles, and use level one, you’ll end up with three Mandragora instead of the typical five. When used during the War of Emperium, the defense value of the castle the plants are in raises the defense of the plants themselves.
Their attacks are considered extensions of your own when it comes to a single thing: auto-cast spells granted by weapons or cards. Status effects and damage increasing cards do not carry over to the plants.
You can only summon more plants once your first plants have died, or gone through their duration time. So long as you remain on screen with them, you will get the experience for their kills.
An effective strategy for all the plants is to summon them, hit/target a monster, and then use a Hiding accessory once the monster is in range of your plants.
Monsters will not attack your plants, thus rendering them sitting ducks until your plants have had their way with them, provided they’re not insect or demon type monsters.
The attacks are of neutral element with the occasional elemental attack corresponding to the plants element. The HIT/Flee stats below are what's required of players to hit/dodge them, not the HIT or Flee of the plant itself.

- ATK is the damage that you would cause to YOURSELF using a normal attack (Thara Frog Card works and decrease damage. The '20% of current HP' rant can NOT be avoided or reduced!)
- MATK is the damage that you would cause to YOURSELF using a neutral property spell
Damage (on yourself) is reduced TWICE - first because of 'half damage to yourself', second because of the Faith skill (that reduces holy damage by half) so players actually get 1/4 damage.
You may not change the equipped shield while you cast this spell. Casting can not be interrupted and the damage ignores size modifications. ^000000

Effect:^777777 Protect party members by taking the full damage that they are receiving. They must be in range to benefit from this, once they leave the skill is canceled and needs to be recasted.
Damage taken is based on the DEF of the person who gets hit, not the Crusader that takes the hit.
If the caster has any self casted, class native enhancements on him, e.g. Endure (Endure transfer is disabled in WoE), Providence or Reflect Shield, the party member(s) will share these benefits, too.
This skill cannot be used on other Crusaders. The level difference between the caster and the target must be equal or less than 10 (within normal EXP share range).
The number of possible protected party members is 1*SkillLV. Should the HP of Crusader drop below 25%, Devotion will be canceled. ^000000

MO_TRIPLEATTACK#
Triple Attack
Required For:^777777 Chain Combo (L5), Tiger Knuckle Fist (L5 Champion) ^000000
Max Level:^777777 10 ^000000
Type:^000099 Passive ^000000
Combo Time:^777777 1.3 sec ^000000
Effect:^777777 Attacks 3 times with increased damage. Higher skill level DECREASES chance of occurrence. This skill differs from the Thief's Double Attack in many key regards.
First of course the delay, as Double Attack takes the same amount of time as a normal attack while this skill takes longer. Triple Attack (and Chain Combo) actually counts for damage as a single strike.
This means that damage bonuses from upgrades, masteries, Star Crumbs, and Spirit Spheres are only applied ONCE and divided evenly among the three (four) visible hits.
Therefore even with LV10 Triple Attack these "individual hits" will usually be weaker than a single normal attack. On the positive side enemy VIT reduction is also only applied once, so against high-VIT targets the total damage may be much higher than expected.
Also, a Thief does not say "Double Attack!!" to every extra hit, while the Monk does.
The Silence status does not stop this skill from activating, and it can be used against the Emperium (though other combos cannot). The delay time is affected by ASPD of the user. ^000000

Duration:^777777 10 + 10*SkillLV sec ^000000
Effect:^777777 This skill operates like the Knight's Auto Counter, but instead "catches" an attacker, freezing both Monk and target for a few moments.
Certain skills are available for you to attack with depending on Blade Stop skill level. Both Monk and attacker are stopped until the Monk uses a skill, the Monk dies, the attacker dies, or Blade Stop's duration expires.
Unlike Freeze/Stone Curse status the attacker still has all Flee and DEF. Further, if the target is a Monk who also has the Blade Stop skill then both are free to use their skills (determined by their own Blade Stop skill level).
This skill can not be used to counter enemy skills. Does not work against Boss monsters. Uses up 1 Spirit Sphere. 
Skill range is 1 cell for barehand and 2 cells for armed. Both characters are still able to use items and change equipment. ^000000

Cool Down:^777777 3.5 - 0.5*SkillLV sec ^000000
Duration:^777777 Instant ^000000
Effect:^777777 Usable only when Critical Explosion is active. Uses all SP to do massive damage to the target, HP/SP will not regenerate naturally for 5 minutes after Asura Strike is used.
Cancels Critical Explosion after use and requires all remaining Spirit Spheres (that is all 5 if cast independently). Damage is [(Weapon ATK+Base ATK) x (8 + SP/10) + 250 + (150*SkillLV)]*Card Effects.
Can be used while catching someone using LV 5 Blade Stop or with no Cast Time at the end of a combo attack (Triple Attack -> Chain Combo -> Combo Finish -> Asura Strike) but the Critical Explosion and Sphere requirements remain in both cases (usable with the 4 spheres remaining after activating Blade Stop/Combo Finish).
Increasing the Asura Strike skill level has a relatively small effect on total damage compared to increasing SP, INT or STR. This skill can be interrupted. ^000000

Effect:^777777 If you use this skill, your HIT and damage will receive a huge increase, but all your defense based upon equipment and stats will decrease.
This skill also gives the Endure effect upon cast without further SP cost and will reset the 7-Hit counter if the Endure effect was already active.
Also, the 10 sec recast Endure timer will be reset, but only if the original effect came from the Swordman Endure Skill (yes, basically you can recast Endure within
the 10 sec with this, but only ONCE, since Concentration-Endure does NOT reset its own Endure timer). Contrary to the IRO name, it can be used with every weapon. ^000000

This Skill also enables you to parry the following skills: Bash, Bowling Bash, Pierce, Spiral Pierce, Brandish Spear, Spear Boomerang, Shield Boomerang, Grand Cross, Asura Strike, Soul Breaker, Double Strafing, Arrow Shower and Investigate.
When you block you cannot attack (but unlike Auto Guard, there is no delay). Use this when you get mobbed. Two Hand sword needed ^000000

Duration:^777777 Instant ^000000
Effect:^777777 Extend your spear, and spin it in a spiral fashion to increase overall damage and ability to pierce. A more powerful version of Pierce which ignores DEF and VIT DEF and also stun-locks your opponent for 3 sec.
Damage is (100+50*SkillLV)% ATK. The attack is 5 hits with the damage divided evenly between the hits. However you can increase damage further by increasing the weight of your weapon (upgrades count too! LV 1 weapons +10/upgrade, LV 2 weapons +15/upgrade, LV 3 weapons +25/upgrade).
Although damage will increase with better skill level, so will the Cast Time / Cool Down. Aura Blade does not add damage to this skill. Recent tests revealed the following (rather complex) formula:
[(80% of weapons weight times (100%+level*50%) + (round.down(STR/10^2) + Upgrade Damage) * size modifier (small 125%, medium 100%, large 75%)) * card factors (+20% and such) * element factors ]* 5 hits ^000000

The paladin can not use Potions, but may receive healing magic, Gospel may cancel out all positive or negative effects on the affected targets (see below for details), but it does not stack with another Gospel.
The effects (positive or negative) can NOT be avoided by Cloaking when staying in the area. ^000000

This skill is an attack by the holy God himself and therefore ignores all enemy defense and Flee, and can not be interrupted or canceled by Magic Rod, Reflect Shield, Pneuma, Safety Wall, etc.
Damage is not reduced by Woe Reduction, Energy Coat, equipment or cards; but is not affected by Lex Aeterna. The only way to avoid it is by Cloaking before getting targeted. ^000000

Cool Down:^777777 None ^000000
Duration:^777777 Next five hits ^000000
Effect:^777777 Each hit you land sacrifices 9% of your Maximum HP to damage your enemy by up to 1.4 times the amount of sacrificed HP. Always hits, but you can die if you use up too many HP with this skill.
Damage on the target is increased according to Maximum HP, Skill Level and weapon +% damage cards, Triple Bloody Boned being the best combo for WoE/PVP.
It ignores Flee and defense of the target. Weapon cards won't increase the amount of HP taken from you. You CANNOT hit the Emperium with it. But you still lose 9% HP if you try.
It's ALWAYS neutral element, meaning Ghostring, Cranial, Poo and Immune reduce its damage on the target. Reflect Shield can reflect the damage.
Magnum Break and Pressure increase their damage. If the enemy is inside a Safety Wall and you attack him, it will miss, but you will lose 9% of your HP anyways.
Ice Pick does not affect Sacrifice damage. Baphomet Card doesn't give Splash damage for Sacrifice hits. Can be used on Boss monsters.
Reject Sword (Stalker skill) has a chance of halving Sacrifice damage (if Sac is used with Sword/Dagger) and reflecting it back to the Paladin. Can be Dispelled. ^000000

The SP drain only works for targeted spells, not area spells. ^000000

The damage of this skill is (30+10*SkillLV)%, but if used right after Break Fall, it becomes stronger as your BaseLV goes up.
Also, this skill has a unique property, when you hit the target player, any TaeKwon/Star Gladiator/Soul Linker-based buffs - such as all Spirit buffs, new skills bestowed by Spirit buffs, or Berserk Potion acquired through Berserk Pitcher - they may have, are all dispelled.
However, if the target player has Preserve skill used on them, then they are invulnerable to this dispel effect. This skill can be Plagiarized by a Rogue.
When this skill is used while using Running skill, the power of this ability will increase based on the character BaseLV.
The power of this skill goes up even further if you do it while under "spurt" mode in Running skill. ^000000

Effect:^777777 You can use this skill only if you are a TaeKwon. You cannot use this skill once you switch to Soul Linker or Star Gladiator.
When you use it, a name of a monster randomly choosed will be displayed and logged.
Then, if you kill that same monster for 100 times (does not have to be in a row), you get 1 Point, and you will be assigned a new randomly selected monster.
When you use this skill while your Target Percent is at 0% (no monster killed yet), you have a 1% chance to receive a new random target.
When you have a certain number of points you become a TaeKwon Ranker (No effect if you are already a Star Gladiator or Soul Linker).
As such, you can do infinite combos of all kicks - Whirlwind Kick, Axe Kick, Round Kick, Counter Kick - but you have to prepare the stance of at least 1 and spam when it triggers.
Also you must make alternate kicks, if you do the same kick twice the spam ends. However, you cannot do Flying Side Kick as part of an infinite combo.
Any LV 90+ TaeKwon Ranker players will have tripled Maximum HP and SP, and be able to use all of the TaeKwon skills. Check the TaeKwon Ranker Fame List by typing "/taekwon". ^000000

ML_SPIRALPIERCE#
Spiral Pierce
Max Level:^777777 5 ^000000
Type:^777777 Offensive ^000000
Target:^777777 Enemy ^000000
SP Cost:^777777 15 + 3*SkillLV ^000000
Cast Time:^777777 0.1 + 0.2*SkillLV sec ^000000
Cool Down:^777777 1 + 0.2*SkillLV sec ^000000
Duration:^777777 Instant ^000000
Effect:^777777 Extend your spear, and spin it in a spiral fashion to increase overall damage and ability to pierce. A more powerful version of Pierce which ignores DEF and VIT DEF and also stun-locks your opponent for 3 sec.
Damage is (100+50*SkillLV)% ATK. The attack is 5 hits with the damage divided evenly between the hits. However you can increase damage further by increasing the weight of your weapon (upgrades count too! LV 1 weapons +10/upgrade, LV 2 weapons +15/upgrade, LV 3 weapons +25/upgrade).
Although damage will increase with better skill level, so will the Cast Time / Cool Down. Aura Blade does not add damage to this skill. Recent tests revealed the following (rather complex) formula:
[(80% of weapons weight times (100%+level*50%) + (round.down(STR/10^2) + Upgrade Damage) * size modifier (small 125%, medium 100%, large 75%)) * card factors (+20% and such) * element factors ]* 5 hits ^000000

Can be shared with party members when the Devotion skill is casted on them, but the movement reduction will affect them too. Caster must have a shield equipped. ^000000

Effect:^777777 Protect party members by taking the full damage that they are receiving. They must be in range to benefit from this, once they leave the skill is canceled and needs to be recasted.
Damage taken is based on the DEF of the person who gets hit, not the Crusader that takes the hit.
If the caster has any self casted, class native enhancements on him, e.g. Endure (Endure transfer is disabled in WoE), Providence or Reflect Shield, the party member(s) will share these benefits, too.
This skill cannot be used on other Crusaders. The level difference between the caster and the target must be equal or less than 10 (within normal EXP share range).
The number of possible protected party members is 1*SkillLV. Should the HP of Crusader drop below 25%, Devotion will be canceled. ^000000

Cool Down:^777777 2 sec ^000000
Duration:^777777 120 sec ^000000
Effect:^777777 Creates a Kyrie Eleison effect on the target character. This effect will block MaxHPofTarget*(10+2*SkillLV)% damage OR (5+SkillLV/2) hits, whichever is reached first.
Damage in excess of the amount blocked will transfer through and count as a hit of lowered damage. Hits are only assessed when a blow would normally land and not for every swing by a monster (despite showing an "Auto Guard" graphic with every swing for the effected player and a miss for every other player).
Any Magic attack will do full damage to the affected target, while still counting against the maximum damage and number of hits of Kyrie Eleison. Casting Holy Light or Assumptio on someone with this effect will cancel it entirely. When a second instance is cast on a target, then it will replace the first instance. ^000000
